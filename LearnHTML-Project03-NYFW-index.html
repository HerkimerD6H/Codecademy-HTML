  <h1> New York Fashion Week: Collection Reviews by Isa</h1>
    <p> Hey everyone! Thanks for joining me to review these exciting new collections that are making their world debut during this year's NYFW! Now, since it's also Week 3 of the NFL season, and there is only <strong><em>one</em></strong> New York Football Team (<a href = "www.buffalobills.com" target = "_blank">!!!</a>), I thought I would focus this blog post on some designers from the official New York Football City itself: BUFFALO!</p>
    <p> I am so excited to show you these new collections by two of Buffalo's own: Matt Milano, and Hailee Steinfeld! Let's check it out!
